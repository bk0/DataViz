        <H2>Project Dataset - Suicide Deaths</H2>
    </p>

    <p>
        <H2>Dataset</H2>
        The source of the dataset is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC").  I had to use the CDC website query tool to retrieve the data so there is no direct link.  The link to the query landing page is located at <a href="http://wonder.cdc.gov/">http://wonder.cdc.gov/</a>.
        <br><br>
        Per the data usage guidelines, I probably won't be able to visualize state-level data.  The acceptable use of the data is as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>Use these data for health statistical reporting and analysis only.</li>
            <li>For sub-national geography, not present or publish death counts of 9 or fewer or death rates based on counts of line or fewer (in figures, graphs, maps, tables, etc.).</li>
            <li>Make no attempt to learn the identity of any person or establishment included in these data.</li>
            <li>Make no disclosure or other use of the identity of any person or establishment discovered inadvertently and advise the NCHS Confidentiality Officer of any such discovery.</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        The dataset contains five numerical ("Year", "Age in Years", "Deaths", "Population", "Crude Rate")
 and two categorical fields ("Sex Race", "State").  If needed, I can re-query and add additional fields such as "State", "Region", "Ethnicity", and "Age Group".  In its current structure, the dataset has approximately 60,000 rows.  If this is too much data, I may use the suicide cause of death dataset which indicates the method of suicide (e.g., firearm, poisoning, falling, suffocation, cutting, etc.).
        <br><br>
        As for my motivation, I was originally intrigued by a table I saw after my Caltrain was severely delayed by a previous train hitting a car and killing the passenger.  I read the news story the next day and it had a link about train suicides are tracked and indicated things like "head on track", "body on track", "standing on track", etc.  I found the level of detail pretty amazing, but I couldn't find it again so, I went with suicides in general.  The detail also has enough detail to give me flexibility in doing different visualizations.
        <br><br>
        The dataset in my Github is linked <a href="https://github.com/bk0/DataViz/blob/gh-pages/project/results.csv">HERE</a>.
